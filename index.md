Digits is an application where users can

* Register an account
* Create and manage contacts
* Add timestamped notes for their interactions with each contact



## Installation

First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Then, download a copy of Digits (please note that Digits is a private repo, so you will need to request permission first).

Now, cd into the app directory to install the required libraries

```
$ meteor npm install
```

## Running the system

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the application using:

```
$ meteor npm run start
```

The first time you run the app, it will create some default users and data. Here is a sample output:

```


=> Started proxy.
=> Started MongoDB.
